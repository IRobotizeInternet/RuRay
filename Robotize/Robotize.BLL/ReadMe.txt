Configuring Google Chrome
To ensure that automated web application testing in Google Chrome runs properly, please set command shown below.

Close chrome browser if opened, and terminate all running Chrome-related background processes.
Right-click the Chrome icon on the desktop, and click Properties.
On the Shortcut tab in the Google Chrome Properties window, edit the contents of the Target text box. 
Append a white space to the existing command, followed by the following flags: 
–remote-debugging-port=9222 –no-first-run –disable-web-security –allow-file-access-from-file –enable-views-textfield –force-renderer-accessibility.

The resultant command line string should look something like the following:

"C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --remote-debugging-port=9222 --no-first-run --disable-web-security --allow-file-access-from-file --enable-views-textfield --force-renderer-accessibility

Goals
----
To be able to create automated tests quickly by using appropriate abstraction layers
The framework should have meaningful logging and reporting structure
Should be easily maintainable and extendable
Should be simple enough for testers to write automated tests
A retry mechanism to rerun failed tests - this is especially useful for WebDriver UI tests

 "The bot detection scripts usually look anything containing word "selenium" / "webdriver" in any of the variables (on window object), and also document variables called $cdc_ and $wdc_. Of course, all of this depends on which browser you are on. All the different browsers expose different things."
